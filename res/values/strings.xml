        <string name="howToPlay">The goal of hearts is to have the least points at the end, the game is over when someone breaks 50 points. 
            \nEach hand is played in thirteen rounds or \'tricks\' of four cards.  The first round is always started with the Two of Clubs.  
            \nThe leading card\'s suit of the trick must be played unless you are void. 
            \nThe highest card of the starting suit (Two to Ace), determines the winner of the trick and then they chooses the next starting card.
            \nEach heart is one point, the Queen of Spades is +13, and the Jack of Diamonds is -10. 
            \nHearts can not be played to start a trick till \'Broken.\'  To break hearts the Queen of Spades or a heart played when void.
            The game is played in four hands per session.  The first three hands players trade three cards before the round begins.\n
            On the fourth round there is no trading, then a new session begins.\n
            On the rare chance a single player takes all the points in a round (Jack of Diamonds excluded). They then \'Shoot the moon.\'
            \nThis takes the 26 points from their score and gives it to everyone else.
